# Predicting the NCAA 2019 Men’s Basketball Championship
Description and Materials for A UVA Data Science Case Study by Catherine Schuster 

## Reference Materials
This folder contains all materials needed for a student to pick up this case study. The hook document, entitled X, outlays the prompt of the case study and 
expected deliverables upon completion. The document "Predictive Analytics for College Basketball: Using Logistic Regression for Determining the Outcome of a Game" is a thesis from the University of New Hampshire Scholars' Repository by Bryce Brown, which contains great examples and tips on how a predictive game outcome model could be implemented. Brown's thesis work is the inspiration for this case study. The document titled "Parametric and Nonparametric: Demystifying the Terms" by Tanya Hoskin, distinguishes parametric and nonparametric statistical machine learning methods, which can be useful for students when finding the optimal model to use for this project. Lastly, the website, [Google Cloud & NCAA® ML Competition 2018-Men's](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/data), provides an example of a Google Cloud competition from 2017, where competitors were tasked with picking a bracket for the 2018 NCAA championship using a combination of NCAA’s historical data and computing power.

## Data
Three recommended data sets are made available for this project. The file Prelim2019_RegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv identifies the game-by-game results for many seasons of historical data, starting with the 2003 season (the first year the NCAA® had a 64-team tournament), and is sourced from the [Google Cloud & NCAA® ML Competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/data). This data is accompanied by Teams.csv, which identifies the different college teams present in the dataset. The file cbb.csv contains aggregated season statistics from the 2013-2019 Division I college basketball seasons, and is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset?resource=download&select=cbb.csv).
