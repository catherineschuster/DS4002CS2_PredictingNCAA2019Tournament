Three recommended data sets are made available for this project. The file Prelim2019_RegularSeasonDetailedResults.csv identifies the game-by-game results for many seasons of historical data, starting with the 2003 season (the first year the NCAA® had a 64-team tournament), and is sourced from the Google Cloud & NCAA® ML Competition on Kaggle. This data is accompanied by Teams.csv, which identifies the different college teams present in the dataset. The file cbb.csv contains aggregated season statistics from the 2013-2019 Division I college basketball seasons, and is sourced from Kaggle.
